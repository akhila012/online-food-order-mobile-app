# online-food-order-mobile-app
The aim of my project is to develop a mobile phone application prototype to facilitate the customers of a particular restaurant with home
delivery services. The customer can choose food items from the given menu of that restaurant through this mobile application and the order will be delivered to their home.

The customer can sign up so that their information like name, address etc is stored in the database for future orders such that they donâ€™t have to mention their address each time.

The service provider uses the data stored in database to seek the address where the order is to be delivered.
